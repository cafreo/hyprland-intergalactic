# Usefull when you have huge home directory which takes
# to long to scan and or when you want to be able to limit the search to some
# directories
# Defaults toÂ :
# MENU=( home )
MENU=(personal work admin)

# For each item `X` defined in the MENU array, you have to define in `d_X` an
# array of directories which will be search for file with `fd`.
# You may also define `f_X` which is an array of file which will be added to
# the rofi menu.
# You may also define additional option to be passed to the `fd` tool in `o_X`
# arrays. See also `FD_OPTIONS` for global options.
#
# The array items will be subject to shell expansion.
